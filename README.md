Respository Practice

## Patient Tracking Database Schema
See `patient_tracking_schema.sql` for an example SQL schema to manage hospitals, floors, physicians, patients, and attachments.

## Patient Tracking Mobile App
A minimal React Native skeleton (`patient_tracking_app` directory) demonstrates a simple four-screen UI:

1. **Hospital/Floor View** – Hierarchical view of hospitals and floors with patient counts.
2. **Add Hospital** – Form to create a new hospital with address, floors, and notes.
3. **Patient View** – List of patients with search and checked-in status display.
4. **Add Patient** – Form to add a patient and optionally create a new hospital.

This code uses Expo and React Navigation to manage screens. It contains placeholder logic and in-memory sample data for demonstration.
